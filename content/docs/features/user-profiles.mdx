## Common Questions

**How do I make my profile stand out?**

Focus on completeness, authenticity, and value. Add a great photo, write a compelling bio, fill out all sections, link to your work, and keep everything updated.

**Who can see my profile?**

This depends on your privacy settings. You can choose to make it public (anyone), private (FairArena members only), or require authentication (logged-in users only).

**Can I see who viewed my profile?**

Yes! Enable "Track Profile Views" in your privacy settings, and you'll be able to see everyone who visits your profile.

**What's the difference between stars and views?**

Views are when someone looks at your profile. Stars are when someone actively chooses to recognize your profile as impressive or valuable. Stars are more meaningful than views.

**Can I hide certain information?**

Yes, many fields are optional. Only add information you're comfortable sharing. You can also adjust privacy settings to control visibility.

**How often should I update my profile?**

Update it whenever something significant changes - new job, new skills, completed projects, etc. A good practice is to review your profile every 3-6 months.

**Can I delete my profile?**

Yes, you can delete your account through your account settings. This will remove all your profile information from the platform.
