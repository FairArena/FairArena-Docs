## Understanding Roles

FairArena uses a comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage what users can do at different levels of the platform.

## Role Hierarchy

### How Roles Work Together

```
Organization Role (Broadest)
  └── Grants organization-wide access
      └── Team Role (Intermediate)
          └── Controls team participation
              └── Project Role (Specific)
                  └── Defines project permissions
```

**Key Principles:**

| Principle | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Inheritance** | Higher roles include lower permissions | Org Admin can access teams |
| **Specificity** | Project roles override team defaults | Project Lead > Team Member |
| **Separation** | Each level independent | Team role ≠ Project role |
| **Flexibility** | Multiple roles possible | Admin in Org, Member in Team |

## Best Practices

### Role Assignment

<Callout type="tip" title="Smart Role Management">
  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Give minimum permissions needed  
  **Regular Reviews:** Audit roles quarterly  
  **Clear Documentation:** Document who has what access  
  **Offboarding Process:** Remove access promptly  
  **Role Templates:** Create standard roles for common positions
</Callout>

### Security Guidelines

**Do:**
- ✅ Assign roles based on job function
- ✅ Review permissions regularly
- ✅ Use custom roles when needed
- ✅ Document role decisions
- ✅ Remove access promptly when not needed
- ✅ Use audit logs to track changes

**Don't:**
- ❌ Over-privilege users
- ❌ Share admin accounts
- ❌ Ignore role reviews
- ❌ Forget to remove ex-members
- ❌ Grant owner role casually

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Can't assign a role">
    **Check:**
    - You have permission to assign roles
    - Role exists and is active
    - Not trying to assign higher role than yours
    - User is member of the entity
    
    **Solution:** Contact owner/admin
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Lost access after role change">
    **Reason:** Your role was changed to lower permissions
    
    **Solution:**
    - Contact team/org admin
    - Request role review
    - Explain access needs
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Custom role not working">
    **Check:**
    - Role is active
    - Permissions are saved
    - User has been assigned role
    - No conflicts with other roles
    
    **Solution:** Review role settings
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
