## Common Questions

**How do I make my profile stand out?**

Focus on completeness, authenticity, and value. Add a great photo, write a compelling bio, fill out all sections, link to your work, and keep everything updated.

**Who can see my profile?**

This depends on your privacy settings. You can choose to make it public (anyone), private (FairArena members only), or require authentication (logged-in users only).

**Can I see who viewed my profile?**

Yes! Enable "Track Profile Views" in your privacy settings, and you'll be able to see everyone who visits your profile.

**What's the difference between stars and views?**

Views are when someone looks at your profile. Stars are when someone actively chooses to recognize your profile as impressive or valuable. Stars are more meaningful than views.

Update it whenever something significant changes - new job, new skills, completed projects, etc. A good practice is to review your profile every 3-6 months.

**Can I delete my profile?**

Yes, you can delete your account through your account settings. This will remove all your profile information from the platform.
